    "The dataset will provide valuable insights into the associations between the outlined explanatory variables and the star count of GitHub repositories. By analyzing this data, we aim to develop models that effectively highlight which variables are most strongly associated with repository popularity. While we will not assume causality, our goal is to assess the relative importance of these explanatory variables and infer which ones demonstrate the strongest relationships with the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our inquiry primarily focuses on inference, as we seek to draw conclusions about the broader population of GitHub repositories. Specifically, we want to determine whether our model can accurately forecast the number of stars a repository might receive based on its characteristics, even for observations outside of the dataset. The accuracy of our predictions will be crucial in evaluating the effectiveness of our analysis and confirming whether we have successfully identified the variables with the highest explanatory power.
